# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Dataset taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

The goal of this project is to practice anomaly detection techniques, dealing with imbalanced datasets, as well as understand some financial data. Furthermore, developing robust and accurate models is important as each undetected fraudulent transaction could potentially cause the bank millions of dollars. After an exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, I fitted the data with three machine learning models:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosted Decision Tree

The performances of the models were evaluated using the area under the precision-recall curve.
